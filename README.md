# Superhero-Database-System
A Windows Forms-based Superhero Management System integrated with Git &amp; GitHub for version control.

#🧩 Project Overview

The One Kick Heroes Academy trains future heroes to handle everything from pop quizzes to full-scale finals-week crises.
Your HQ development team built a C# Windows Forms application that replaces chaotic paper-based hero records with a digital database.

The system lets academy assessors:

- Add, update, delete, and view superhero data.

- Automatically calculate hero Ranks and Threat Levels from exam scores.

- Generate analytical summary reports.

- Manage all development changes through Git version control and GitHub hosting.
